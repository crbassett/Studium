<p>This hymn, based upon Philippians 2:5-11, is set to the melody ‚ÄúO Gott, Du Frommer Gott‚Äù (CW 459).</p>

<hr />

<p>Your attitude should be <br />
The same Christ was displaying. <br />
As He in poverty <br />
On this poor earth was staying! <br />
He did not tightly cling <br />
To His glory divine. <br />
He made himself nothing: <br />
A Pilgrim within time.</p>

<p>In servant‚Äôs form was made <br />
In action and behavior, <br />
As a poor man displayed, <br />
He came to earth, our Savior. <br />
He humbled himself low <br />
And suffered pain and loss, <br />
Death He did undergo, <br />
Even death on a cross.</p>

<p>So God Him highly raised! <br />
His dying makes us living. <br />
A wondrous name of praise <br />
He now to Him is giving. <br />
This name climbs high above <br />
All others, great or small. <br />
This name of pow‚Äôr and love: <br />
Christ Jesus, Lord of All!</p>

<p>And at this very name <br />
Must ev‚Äôry knee be bending <br />
In heav‚Äôn and hell, the same, <br />
And through the world extending, <br />
All that He did create <br />
Must speak with one accord, <br />
Confessing small and great <br />
That Jesus Christ is Lord!</p>

<p>Let ev‚Äôry single tongue <br />
Learn to confess it proudly. <br />
My heart, let praise be sung <br />
To your great Savior loudly. <br />
Let glory be outpoured <br />
On Him who the Son sent. <br />
Christ Jesus is my Lord, <br />
Forever praised. Amen!</p>
