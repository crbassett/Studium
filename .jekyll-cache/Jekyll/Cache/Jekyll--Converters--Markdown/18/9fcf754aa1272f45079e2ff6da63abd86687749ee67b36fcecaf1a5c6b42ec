<p>Johannes Olearius (1611-1684) served as a pastor and General Superintendent. Other hymns by him include ‚ÄúComfort, Comfort All My People‚Äù (CW 11) and ‚ÄúLord, Open Now My Heart to Hear‚Äù (CW 282). This beautiful Christmas hymn basks in the glow of the incarnation of our God.</p>

<p><strong>Merciful and Wondrous Throne</strong>
<em>Wunderbarer Gnadenthron</em> (KELG126)</p>

<p>Merciful and wondrous Throne, <br />
Son of God and Mary‚Äôs Son, <br />
God and man, an infant small <br />
Is found sleeping in a stall, <br />
Hero from eternity <br />
Of whose might and majesty <br />
Boasts all Christianity.</p>

<p>As in poverty You live, <br />
You to me great riches give. <br />
Mighty God, You meek became <br />
Death and hell to put to shame. <br />
To the whole world this is shown, <br />
Even to the devil‚Äôs own: <br />
Wonderful is God alone!</p>

<p>Let Your faithfulness, I pray, <br />
Be to me renewed each day. <br />
God, my God, forsake me not <br />
When by perils I‚Äôm distraught. <br />
Your most wondrous majesty <br />
And Your goodness, Lord, let me <br />
View for all eternity.</p>
