I"ê<p>This hymn, which focuses on the importance and blessings of being connected to God, draws from the imagery of Psalm 84. It is set to the melody ‚ÄúErhalt Uns, Herr‚Äù (<em>Christian Worship</em> 203).</p>

<hr />

<p>As does the sparrow his house choose <br />
And her small nest the swallow views, <br />
So I your Altar, Lord, now seek, <br />
In all I think and do and speak.</p>

<p>Lord, help me through the vale of woe. <br />
Your servants grant where‚Äôer they go, <br />
That they your living spring may tend <br />
And from the pure faith never bend. \</p>

<p>Far better, Lord, it is to be <br />
The least in Your community <br />
Than all earth‚Äôs majesty to claim: <br />
Its fleeting pow‚Äôr, fortune, and fame. \</p>

<p>You are our shield, our sun ablaze, <br />
Our Lord who gives honor and grace. <br />
Each day, O Lord, our faith renew <br />
And turn our wand‚Äôring hearts to you.</p>
