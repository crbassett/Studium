<p>Sigmund von Birken (1626-1681) was a famous German poet. He wrote many hymns, only a few of which are still used today including “Jesus, I Will Ponder Now” (CW 98) and “Let Us Ever Walk with Jesus” (CW 452). This hymn, set to the melody “Jesu, Meines Lebens Leben” (CW 114), is a confident prayer to Christ our Good Shepherd.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jesus, good and faithful shepherd <br />
Who the flocks of men does keep <br />
Lead me by your rod and voice, Lord. <br />
Let me be your little sheep. <br />
By what great love you were driven <br />
That your life for sheep was given, <br />
And for me you gave it too. <br />
Let me in return love you.</p>

<p>Shepherds love their sheep so dearly, <br />
And the sheep return his love. <br />
Let’s display our love as clearly, <br />
I on earth and you above. <br />
When you call with love abounding, <br />
I shall be an echo sounding. <br />
When you cry out, “I love you,” \ 
Cries my heart, “I love you too.”</p>

<p>Sheep know well who is their master, <br />
And he knows them each by name. <br />
Let me run to you still faster <br />
As to me you running came. <br />
When the wolf of hell confounds me <br />
And has clamped his jaws around me, <br />
Then you cry out, “I know you,” <br />
And I cry, “I know you too.”</p>

<p>Sheep hear when the shepherd calls them, <br />
Following his voice alone, <br />
And he hears both great and small and <br />
Takes their troubles as his own. <br />
Let me hear when you address me. <br />
Let me run where’re you press me. <br />
Let me always you obey. <br />
Jesus hear me too, I pray.</p>

<p>Jesus, hear my call for rescue. <br />
To your small sheep turn your ear. <br />
Teach me, Lord, for help to ask you <br />
When the vicious wolf draws near. <br />
Let my cries to you be pleasing. <br />
Grant me comfort without ceasing. <br />
When I pray, “Please hear my words,” <br />
Jesus, say, “You I have heard.”</p>

<p>Listen, Jesus, hear my bleating. <br />
Do not hide from me your face. <br />
When I’m crying, begging, pleading, <br />
Jesus, help me with your grace. <br />
In your name you hear me again. <br />
In you all is Yes and Amen. <br />
What great comfort now is mine <br />
Through the Good Shepherd divine.</p>
