<p>Johann Jacob Rambach (1693-1735) was a professor of theology at both Halle and Giessen. Although he was to some degree caught up in both the pietist and rationalist movements, he did leave the Lutheran church many wonderful hymns, including ‚ÄúBaptized into Your Name Most Holy‚Äù (CW294) and ‚ÄúMy Maker, Be with Me‚Äù (CW598). This joyful Christmas hymn is sung to the melody ‚ÄúWie Wohl Ist Mir, O Freund Der Seelen.‚Äù</p>

<p>Your Mediator comes, you weak soul <br />
Of Moses‚Äô thund‚Äôrous curse afraid <br />
And in an anxious, grief-filled, deep hole <br />
By dark and gloomy shackles stayed! <br />
See! The Satanic chains are tearing <br />
Which your poor spirit were ensnaring! <br />
The bonds are loosed! The curse is done! <br />
For free salvation be now hoping. <br />
God is appeased, His heart stands open: <br />
Your gracious Mediator comes!</p>

<p>Your Teacher comes. Hear what He‚Äôs saying. <br />
Give ear to the mouth of the Lord. <br />
When lost, He is your way displaying. <br />
On you are light and truth outpoured. <br />
That which dark shadows were concealing <br />
Your Prophet is for you revealing. <br />
Night‚Äôs reign is ended by the Son, <br />
Proclaiming as the Father wills it <br />
Giving you power to fulfill it: <br />
Your wise, all-knowing Teacher comes!</p>

<p>Your King now comes, but without fanfare. <br />
His entrance rich in poverty. <br />
Receive your Prince, who does as man share <br />
With you your deep humility! <br />
Come, then, and kiss His hand and scepter <br />
For since He is your sure Protector, <br />
The floods of fear can harm you none. <br />
And in a faithful subject‚Äôs manner <br />
Come swear yourself unto His banner: <br />
Your long-awaited King now comes!</p>

<p>Your Ev‚Äôrything comes to complete you. <br />
Your A and Z stands at your door. <br />
Those with this blessing would be pleased to <br />
Trade for it all the world and more. <br />
Grasp it, then, with both hands securely, <br />
And from all sides, my spirit, surely <br />
A sea of grace you overruns. <br />
So clear a path for His procession! <br />
Open the doors! He‚Äôs your possession: <br />
Poor nothing, your Ev‚Äôrything comes!</p>
