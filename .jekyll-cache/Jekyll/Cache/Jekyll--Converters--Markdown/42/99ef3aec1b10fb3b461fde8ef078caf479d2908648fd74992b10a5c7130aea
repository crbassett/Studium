<p>Philip von Zesen (1619-1689) was an influential German writer and poet. The son of a Lutheran pastor, many of his writings contain references to Christianity. This hymn, which specifically describes the joy of Jesus’ coming at Christmas, is set to the melody “Wie Schön Leuchtet” (CW 79).</p>

<p><strong>O Princely Child from David’s Stem</strong>
<em>O Fürstenkind aus Davids Stamm</em> (KELG133)</p>

<p>O Princely Child from David’s Stem, <br />
My Life, my Comfort, and my Friend, <br />
My Soul’s Bridegroom and Savior, <br />
I should thank You eternally  <br />
That You draw near in poverty– <br />
What could I give You ever? <br />
We know <br />
No woe, <br />
Joyful always <br />
Sing we God’s praise, <br />
Sadness waning, <br />
For the Prince of Peace is reigning.</p>

<p>I myself full of gladness live– <br />
I know not what I ought to give <br />
The chosen child from above. <br />
Take for Yourself, O Child most kind, <br />
Take now my courage, heart, and mind. <br />
Ignite my soul with Your love. <br />
And be <br />
In me <br />
Sealed securely <br />
That I surely <br />
Ne’er replace You, <br />
But in love ever embrace You.</p>

<p>Stay, Priceless Treasure, Jewel most bright, <br />
Stay with me, O my heart’s Delight, <br />
The Hope of all the weary. <br />
Dew from Heaven, O make me grow. <br />
O Wondrous Manna, Yourself show <br />
To outcasts poor and dreary. <br />
Keep bright <br />
Your Light <br />
On the earth here <br />
As in Heav’n clear. <br />
To those pining <br />
Bring Your Word forever shining.</p>
