<p>*Soul, Leave Affairs of Earth Behind You** is a hymn written by Erdmann Neumeister about the Lord’s Supper. The hymn walks the believer’s soul through preparation for Holy Communion, leading him to put his confidence in Jesus Christ rather than his own merit.</p>

<p>I see but bread and wine before me, <br />
Yet faith perceives a higher good, <br />
For in both holy pieces worthy <br />
Are Christ’s, my Savior’s, flesh and blood <br />
To this our full belief is due. <br />
His Word is trustworthy and true.</p>

<p>With Jesus’ flesh I have been nourished <br />
So that I can his temple be <br />
Since Christ resides within, I flourish; <br />
As I own him, so he owns me. <br />
He leads me on my whole life through <br />
And I begin to live anew.</p>

<p>Now doubt can live in me no longer; <br />
The grace of God is all I see. <br />
No man on earth nor crafty devil <br />
Has pow’r to throw my sins at me! <br />
Righteous I am, as white as snow <br />
Nothing condemns me; this I know!</p>

<p>Since Christ has given me his body, <br />
Which is for all the source of life. <br />
Therefore, my flesh must life embody, <br />
Though by decay devoured in strife. <br />
This is faith’s comfort and it’s goal, <br />
In life and when God calls my soul.</p>

<p>Jesus has died for me, it follows, <br />
Yes, that for me my Jesus lives! <br />
He’s won for me life without sorrows <br />
In dying this my heart hope gives <br />
Someday I’ll go to heaven bright <br />
Impeccable before his sight.</p>
