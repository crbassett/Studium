<p>Salomon Franck (1659-1725) was a lawyer who was most famous for his poetry. Many of his poems were set to music by Johann Sebastian Bach. Among his many works are â€œI Leave All Things to Godâ€™s Directionâ€ (CW414) and â€œO God, Forsake Me Notâ€ (CW424). This hymn, which meditates on the joy that from eternity God has by grace and in Christ elected his own for heaven, is set to the melody â€œWer Nur Den Lieben Gottâ€ (CW444).</p>

<hr />

<p>I know my name in heavâ€™n is written. <br />
Saved and redeemed, Godâ€™s child I am. <br />
When by both sins and sorrows smitten <br />
I am content: I fear not them. <br />
I know that from eternity <br />
God has in Christ elected me.</p>

<p>With his own blood the Lamb recorded <br />
My name into the Book of Life <br />
And evâ€™ry blessing me awarded <br />
Freeing me from deathâ€™s curse and strife. <br />
What torment still could vex my heart? <br />
I am for heaven set apart.</p>

<p>Though in the Book of Sinâ€™s black binding <br />
My heavy debt against me stands <br />
In Jesus I pure grace am finding. <br />
The Book of Life He to me hands. <br />
My sure election I view there. <br />
Godâ€™s Word reveals me as his heir.</p>

<p>Joyful in death, on Christ relying, <br />
I shall put on faithâ€™s wedding dress, <br />
Which with his blood the Lamb was dyeing, <br />
That this salvation Iâ€™d posess <br />
And at his banquet have a place. <br />
Joyful election, all by grace!</p>

<p>Devils canâ€™t steal this consolation: <br />
God chose me from eternity. <br />
By grace through faith I have salvation <br />
Which Jesusâ€™ blood obtained for me. <br />
So upon Christ I run my race, <br />
Living and dying in this grace.</p>
