Johann Jacob Rambach (1693-1735) was a professor of theology at both Halle and Giessen. Although he was to some degree caught up in both the pietist and rationalist movements, he did leave the Lutheran church many wonderful hymns, including "Baptized into Your Name Most Holy" (CW294) and "My Maker, Be with Me" (CW598).
