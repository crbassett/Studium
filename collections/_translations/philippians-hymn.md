Your attitude should be \\
The same Christ was displaying. \\
As He in poverty \\
On this poor earth was staying! \\
He did not tightly cling \\
To His glory divine. \\
He made himself nothing: \\
A Pilgrim within time. 

In servant’s form was made \\
In action and behavior, \\
As a poor man displayed, \\
He came to earth, our Savior. \\
He humbled himself low \\
And suffered pain and loss, \\
Death He did undergo, \\
Even death on a cross. 

So God Him highly raised! \\
His dying makes us living. \\
A wondrous name of praise \\
He now to Him is giving. \\
This name climbs high above \\
All others, great or small. \\
This name of pow’r and love: \\
Christ Jesus, Lord of All! 

And at this very name \\
Must ev’ry knee be bending \\
In heav’n and hell, the same, \\
And through the world extending, \\
All that He did create \\
Must speak with one accord, \\
Confessing small and great \\
That Jesus Christ is Lord! 

Let ev’ry single tongue \\
Learn to confess it proudly. \\
My heart, let praise be sung \\
To your great Savior loudly. \\
Let glory be outpoured \\
On Him who the Son sent. \\
Christ Jesus is my Lord, \\
Forever praised. Amen!
