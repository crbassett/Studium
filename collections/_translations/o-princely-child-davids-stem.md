<strong>O Princely Child from David’s Stem</strong>
<em>O Fürstenkind aus Davids Stamm</em> (KELG133)

O Princely Child from David’s Stem,
My Life, my Comfort, and my Friend,
My Soul’s Bridegroom and Savior,
I should thank You eternally
That You draw near in poverty--
What could I give You ever?
We know
No woe,
Joyful always
Sing we God’s praise,
Sadness waning,
For the Prince of Peace is reigning.

I myself full of gladness live--
I know not what I ought to give
The chosen child from above.
Take for Yourself, O Child most kind,
Take now my courage, heart, and mind.
Ignite my soul with Your love.
And be
In me
Sealed securely
That I surely
Ne’er replace You,
But in love ever embrace You.

Stay, Priceless Treasure, Jewel most bright,
Stay with me, O my heart’s Delight,
The Hope of all the weary.
Dew from Heaven, O make me grow.
O Wondrous Manna, Yourself show
To outcasts poor and dreary.
Keep bright
Your Light
On the earth here
As in Heav’n clear.
To those pining
Bring Your Word forever shining.
